Iteration  1:
  Term  6, STAT  1, Obj = -100.000000
  Term  7, STAT  1, Obj = -450.000000
                                 SOL = -450.000000
Iteration  2:
  Term  6, STAT  1, Obj = 0.000000

===============================================
Optimal solution found     =      -450.000000
Best objective value       =             -inf
Relative gap               =              inf%
